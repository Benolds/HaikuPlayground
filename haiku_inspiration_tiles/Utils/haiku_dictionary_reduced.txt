filling on a deserted island
a wine bottle

comes to the river
flooded

drop
by
drop
the river floods

of a spring-flooded river
back in the wind

the river valley
up to my toes

flowing sideways
into fence rows

into the sea

in the beginning
before we awake
there's the ocean

you breath as lightly
as the sky

refreshed by sleep

in me

a damp breathing
from a rock

sucking from the spring
a life sound

cemetery wind
sounds in the shells
of one's ears

all of their possession
side by side
cemetery plots

out of the cemetery
the first laugh
a cold wind

thunder
knees on graveyard earth
tremble

their eyes closed
to a million dollar view
a seaside cemetery

crossroads cemetery
the old man asks
the way home

buried here
autumn woods are full
of ancestors

late in autumn
chilled waters still

leaving the cemetery

on frost-cracked soil

packing the powdery snow
into useless patterns

photographing
the graves
without film

church bells
a spade cuts through
stony ground

open grave
frosted air penetrates
deep into earth

tending the graves
the dirt under my nails
is just a beginning

childless
standing beside a mother
at a child's grave

out of the grave
the sinking casket
pushes the light

a frosty night
gravestones rise
the width of a crack

hole in the silence
grave diggers alone
lower the coffin

between the graves
fences between friends
falling apart

visiting graves
the stone at dusk
warms

visiting graves
stone gardens lengthen
autumn's cool

his grave
filled with
his earth

his grave
covered with
my sky

rain
covering his grave
with low clouds

juicy blackberries
under the tangled vines
a forgotten grave

after visiting graves
a night of fever-chills
their nightmares

late afternoon
afraid to take nap
while visiting graves

gravestones

last daughter
selling his house
setting a stone

"gone but not forgotten"
the white obelisk
in a patch of weeds

forgetting where
the family stone
sinks in

tombstones
marking those things
that don't die

yet patches of purple
shadow

home

steps to the cabin
where you once lived
low in broken grass

selling the house
the scratch of a pen
in the family name

a chain of old keys
in a closed house
unlocking memories

the deed signed
taking down the birdhouse
dad built

bodies buried
and now the house belongs
to someone else

village lights
stretch down the road
draw us home

the afternoon sun
slants over a hand-made house
paints it September

selling the house
one last swim in the lake
the water's calm

flying home
at 35,000 feet my folks
are not here either

walks alone around the house
on one leg

inverted in the crater
invisible

movement of a bush
an animal the wind
of mountains moving

white clouds
bury the mountains
in deepest black

mountains between us
holding back the dawn
hours of my longing

mountain caves
wind carving empty
eye sockets

ritual ground

bodies
on Indian ritual ground
wrecked cars

where Indians died
the carcasses of ponies
of old cars

Indian rocks
the night hawk's spirit
with a whir of wings

ridges

pages torn
from a sketchbook
far mountain ridges

covering my feet wet
with golden leaves

in this light
flowing through the ages

roll upstream

on the long waves of autumn
end of a day

in the desert landscape
my bones

ascending alone
the threshold to heaven

in one of its rocks

shaping the moonlight

where a rock fell away
shining

strangers
on the city side walks
one has his laugh

lamplight
straightening the street
of narrow houses

approaching the temple
grasses rub the body
of a snake

logging road
cut trees that never come
to the temple

before the temple
lizards turn
the grass brown

climbing temple hill
leg muscles tighten
in our throats

breathless
atop the steep hill
temple pagoda

breathless
climbing to the pagoda
wind

sea winds blow
from temple copper domes
holy sunshine

Tibetan temple
the high-pitched hum
of an air plane

to our round eyes
temple splendors
a locked gate

temple secrets
held together
a chain link fence

temple fence
red and yellow prayer flags
poison ivy

holy smells
free in the air
between fences

finding something
we could see

in the making

suddenly the sun
at a beach picnic

by low tide now covered
with night waters

have a sound

beyond the cemetery
white with snow

fill the open field
sky high

stuffed with cotton

across sky-blue waters

where the sun sank
a ship sails cool
on western waters

waving the ocean's brightness
a blue-white flag

winter white
on the ocean's block of blue
melting crust of foam

each flat wave
a dirty gray

pounding the beach
with storm wild waves
the foghorn

storm waves
falling from angel shoulders

warms spindrift
in the sun

and slow
