she lifts her head
a tapping at the window
is only rain

rain
opening the window
a light heart

a south wind
polishing my face clean
for this journey

spring winds
the old lady tries again
to tidy her hair

spring mists
on these long evenings
someone's coming

an unknown boat
coming into the harbor
touches me

walking to work
our sleeves touch
starch on silk

asking for a ride
his answer dotted
with music

static electricity
garbled introductions
they lean together

panty hose
she crosses her legs
with whispers

woman and her pillow
curled around a notebook
dawn's first light

light
imprinting the stone
rings

awe

as one of us
the child watches
an earthworm

being loved

warm under quilts
the young couple lie quiet
in the place of one

rain drops
falling around the bed
her hair pins

his body a bow
his arrow shot me
full of flowers

spring storms
at their climax
thunder rolls away

rain shower
afterwards he reads to me
all of his poems

eyes
into eyes
lights

after lovemaking
all is quiet until
rain begins again

a woman's cry
the shower begins
with lightning

orgasm
an explosion of flowers
in wind chimes

tangled in sleep
on a sea weed strewn beach
lovers

flooded river
sides flowing together
lovers touch

dripping
spring rain and your body
in mine

driftwood lair
lovers hidden from view
found by the wind

lying in a river
words of love
in the current

boredom

rain
idle fingers strumming
the dulcimer

one ear
listening to the river
wet with rain

rain dripping
one hour
into another

these long days
watching the sky fade
with closed eyes

river winds
flipping white pages
without poems

rain erases time
one hour reused
the whole day long

in this rain my house
a stone in the stream
I a female fossil

scattered
among driftwood
drifters

companionship

touching his face
the slope of her forehead
echoes

new friends meet
snow-melt streams
into the river

walking
the river comes
along too

meeting an old friend
at the mountain stream
a bear

silence
around lovers
a silver cord

lovers in church
giggling at the term
immaculate

afternoon rain
into my sleep
your pencil moves

book covers
renewing a friendship
somewhat faded

clipboard
unable to tell
your poem from mine

complaints of lovers

daybreak
the person you love
is not perfect

without love
sea kelp growing
a holdfast

alone
but not alone
the sun - the moon

so easy to love
yet she always fumbles
locks and keys

organ drone
mother's warning
about choirboys

rain complaining
of the steepness of the lane
to his lover's house

parting
at the river
weeping willows

unwanted child
wearing a name
that doesn't fit

crying at dawn
gulls
and a lonely woman

desire

morning fog
dreams not buried
deep enough

spring sunshine
the strangeness of his perfectly
normal thumbnail

sunny sea winds
shoulders ache
for the want of wings

kids laughing
in the neighbor's house
the childless couple

moonlight moving
with the gate as the servant girl
takes an evening

unemployed carpenter
l-o-v-e
tattooed on his knuckles

Saturday rain
the desire to buy something
extravagant

Saturday rain
desire by a warm stove
for an affair

static electricity
a silken sleeve is drawn
to the amber

white surf
wanting to keep the ocean
free of oil wells

waterfall
delicate forms
for a spirit

buying
Scotch magic tape
as it were

dreams

dinosaur claws
taken to a rocky beach
a dreaming mind

ballet movies
all night her dreams
tip-toe

dreaming I was
the sleeve of your coat
I learned your secret

acrobat family
mine - if I ran away
to the circus

roar of the surf
sleeping on the beach
a child dreams

napping
among driftwood logs
sleeping

awakening
furniture
with chipped veneers

ephemeral

up and down
driftwood lairs of lovers
come and go

tide pool still
as if it is tomorrow
I'm not here

fading
condolence cards
the sting

sea spray
a rock writes
another name

spirals
the world tied together
with double helixes

a watch
left out in the rain
timeless

excitement


three fingertips
pressed to a cheek telling
of a new love affair


tide turns
leaping white into the cove
our eyes


raindrops
in a waterfall
glory-rush


surf's surge and boom
brushing my teeth
in a stranger's bathroom

each white wave
mounts the black rock
differently

waves crash
in the trickling away
another crests

hour by hour
the wave-white sea
becomes the wind

spring run-off
a little more - a little less
humans get so excited

expectation

waist
long-gone encircles
a child

rented house
the ocean's roar
in mother's womb

tugging at my sleeve
the a wind a voice
saying mommy!

the widow
taking swimming lessons
from the life guard

on a bridge
a young couple discuss
old lovers

expansion

nest
the fullness of spring
with eggs

lunch
time by the brook
spring-fed

always further
down the road frogs
and the dark

on the long pier
a tall father tells his son
how deep the ocean is

winds on the beach
going inland to remind you
of my love

thin and pale
the air of spring
leaving in flowers

smooth seas
upon jagged shores
the power

expectation

a love affair
building a fire
in a strange stove

the new couple
one looks upstream
the other down

dropping sticks
in the flooded river
their fortune

happiness

rivers
taking care of us
small fishes

earth
each spot layered
with stories

sunshine
on the hobo's back
hitchhiking

song
from a fence post
meadow lark

the night is shortened
by your letters on the pillow
here beside me

coming together
your nearness
my music

hope

the road before us
departing clouds bright
with a rising sun

increase

so much rain
this year how the kids
have grown

jealousy

turning green
each wave crests
higher than the last

thunder
his first date
not hers

joy

spring rain
your gentleness seems to know
no sorrow

to off-shore rocks
spring comes rowing
lovers in a boat

parents
showing the newborn
to the rising sun

lips
take from the springs
whistling

lust

cut crystal rainbow
shining where he wanted
to touch her

warming
her feelings of love
the hot springs

ducks
paddling around
lovers

invisible thrusting
the mountain raises
all of us

flooded river
rubbing low skies
electric current

a woman's slit
sliding over granite
a spring

spring
the urge to scratch
the earth with a hoe

randy again
her voice on the phone says
"... he wants me"

treasured gift
her smooth stone calls
as the phone rings

gentle breathing
night rain comes alive
tapping on the window

society dame
flirts with an unreal cowboy
her teenage romance

dawn's faint hour
awakens under closed eyes
a shiver of pictures

desiring you
rain drums
in my ears

love duet
everyone in the music class
crosses their legs

pearl buttons
undoing her blouse
two soft ones

patterns
your words open
the iris

new life

tumbling surf
water voices of children
within the womb

heavy surf
that sound I heard before
being born

soft things
inheriting a pattern
in time

desert wind
naked as the crack
where I was born

silence
baby's blue eyes
without tears

fingerprints
the tiny scars
for life

lying in your lap
the dense smell of musk
a birthday gift

the poise of coming
forward waves on a beach
a baby's first steps

passion

this need to love
mountains give to spring
flowers

downpour
your fingers
inside me

sun setting
emerald waves free
our passion

illuminated
in the light from the barn
their first kiss

rain
pounding in love
all night

rain on the roof
wet around us
on the sheets

kisses
in your open mouth
the rest of you

in and out
of the river's mouth
a tongue of sea

opening my legs
to the flooded river
currents meet

jerking off
the love scene played
by marionettes

peace

deep humming
waves unrolling
the bay

relaxed
cherry flowers unfold
peace

across the fence
with his cherry in bloom
I can forgive him

planting peas
a harvest today
of peace

asleep
morning seas quiet
pink

raised up
within the protection
a mountain unfolding

pleasure

a touch of silk
caressing her body
glistening sperm

vacation
utterly exhausted
by pleasure

seduction

local flirt
two pair of wool socks
below a backless dress

standing still
his glance begins
the dance

silence
between eyes
love lights

her hem
the wind lifts
a little fog

giving him
a bite of her
oldest apple tree
- for Marlene Mountain

deep sea green waters
sheltered by a cove slipping
into something frothy

unfaithfulness

rented house
rows of ocean waves
seem unfaithful

a strange house
the new nightgown
seems unfaithful

youthfulness

a young girl
chewing gum in conversation
with herself

river childhood
banging a bucket
boat sides

tea house
a child feds the koi fish
his fortune

how proudly it waves
the American flag T-shirt
on her young breasts

wet dreams
the man in the moon
was once young

wind perfumed
from a woman's shoulder
desert night

after loving

leaving the beach
only she has sand
on her back

sand
where lovers laid
a shallow depression

summer sun
drops of sweat mingle
with sperm

eyelids closed
the naked sleepers
curled into fish

lying naked
open to summer stars
this old couple

the whole bed
yet he lays his head
in my hand

sea fog
hiding morning-mussed hair
places you've kissed

sweeping the floor
sunrise on papers
left by lovers

anger

he's angry again
alone on the porch
with a red star

hot air
his arguments
on my face

crumpled silence
after the argument
moth wings

our angry silence
old faithful geyser
blows off steam

this heat
the harp too
out of tune

the neighbor lady
scolding her child
is also god

being lazy

picking up sleep
where you left it at dawn
afternoon nap

sun from the east
ocean waves from the west
our entertainment

dancing

dancing on the beach
I jab a stick into the sky
to break up the blue

white dance
in the beach walk skirt
folds of moonlight

I come to you clothed
only in the dampness of fog
and our dancing

delight in the new

hard glances
the sun on the sea
a virile man

she
showing him a sea cave
and more

almond nails
pressed into brown skin
a faint perfume

moon lights
houses of hermit crabs
my damp blanket

desire to travel

star paths
the tender roots
of passion

voices
bridging the stream
stepping stones

your voice
tying me to the desert
toast pops up

airport phone call
the heart leaves
without luggage

flying
the mountains bend down
to our meeting

dread of autumn

koi dart and hide
from the net dipped
coming of autumn

departing summer
and when it's gone
the river's low

one leaf floats
in the sand castle's moat
end of summer

circus acrobats
come to the end of summer
leaping and falling

dreaming

asleep in a boat
to dream the dreams
of water lilies

desert nights
the clarity of dreams
warm and real

dream dancer
sleeping without a pillow
on scarred boards

remembering a dream
and then the circus
was over

eyes closed
knowing by heart
the rest

- for Virgilio

enjoyment

days so complete
words become the calls of birds
the high tide wind

only borrowed
this summer day
this beach

wet silk
cupping her breast
night river

outdoor shower
bathed in sun colors
of hot water

slipping into the pool
naked divides the night
sun-warmed waters

gentle nights
of desert wind
a woman's breast

touching myself
your name
on my lips

placing the flute
against her lips something
slips into place

fickleness

British pub
an unfaithful man blows
suds from his beer

getting into bed
the stranger
even browner

eating melon
bites given on the point
of his knife

fullness

the blood circle
mother and daughter wading
in the surf

I'm not old
all night my eyes have held
the ancient stars

with the ocean's roar
I climb the hills home
not alone

sweeping bare floors
the summer empty cabin
very full

happiness

glowing
a flag unfurls
native happiness

long summer day
how many animals
I've been

on a bright sunny day
comes your smiling face
light added to light

just two stars
yet our eyes are closed
in ecstasy

high cliff
the heart beats the blue sky
like a flaying stick

kissing

kissing
together in a glass
our toothbrushes

desert kisses
hotter
than ever before

morning stars fade
waking a small bird
our lips

laughter

summer night
empty mountain road filled
with our laughter

- for Kenichi Sato

laughter added to the heat
my lover's farts can't kill
mosquitoes

angel wings
propelled through the air
by laughter

loving

tongue
tasting
pink

shapes
pure light the face
of a loved one

blue spots
tattooed with love
from his teeth

lovers
pulse of fire gods
in bubbling waters

lovers
cradled in caves
lovers

hot tongues
the little language
of lovers

lovers
the lamplighted lane
a way away

nights
the grove of little trees
swollen with lovers

moon white water
lovers in the secret cove
Saturday night

just as tangled
paths in the berry patch
lovers

lovers
heat of a summer night
fill the moon

making love
the unevenness of boards
on the porch

skin
touching
whispers

a butterfly
from your finger
light touches

following wet tracks
into the secret garden
he enters

hovering hums
mosquitoes watch us
making love

memories

packing
between unworn shirts
sea sounds

moments of forever
beach day chitin
fossil in lava

gazing into fires
seals in my mind
wind-water pictures

red marks
from your white teeth
mosquito bites

curving sandstone cliffs
the yellow school bus
where time stands still

memories
over a river of sunlight
a time bridge

oneness

the narrow bed
we breath each other
all afternoon

on bare arms
the noon-day sun melted
hot metal sweet

before the summer storm
rises the close smell
of two skins

after paying
the whore seems to be
someone's sister

applause
scenery painted
by a one-armed boy

openness

company's coming
over-friendly flies
buzzing at the door

prostitute
now a freeway rest area
her mother's home

outdoor fun

finally it's Friday
the passion flower blooms
wrinkling the bedspread

crawling on the bed
tendrils of passion flowers
thick on the porch

shadows of leaves
cover the open holes
her flute forgotten

the sun and hunger
watches without winding
on a summer day

panic

tourist fear
the ocean will ruin
Land's End clothes

clasped hands
holding the nervousness in
his thumbs

in rain in sun
how do you run from your hours
window box zinnia?

shelling peas
the pregnant woman asks
"Is forty old?"

silence
in a knot hole
stares

pride

traveling through
Basho in your town
you in mine

- for Kenichi Sato

relaxed

beach party
losing in the sand
her many years

a world closed
the roar of surf
plugs my ears

quiet evening
all the wind
back in the flute

on vacation
the summer sun
far out to sea

relief

summer stars
finding all the familiar things
edged with morning

campfire embers
all the demons nearly gone
in the morning sun

distance softens
and rounds the hills
our relationship

satisfaction

his penis in her
lightning strikes
very close

a gentle rain
in me
your poems

curve of a wave
holding perfect
a summer day

satisfaction
the cooling breeze
between lovers

my head
resting on the pillow
of your voice

we share these hours
gifts with many small parts
complete together

beaches where no one goes
their share of sand
gentle waves

tiny cabin
distant shelter of woods
and sky within me

temptation

caught between rocks
seaweed in the rising tide
seems to wave to me

smooth sand
following waves
back to the sea

tired

summer weary
the sky leans down an arch
of cypress

asleep
holding your breath
in my hand

wanting to be loved

beach-blown
my sea-foam body
awaits your hand

hot night
legs spread wide
where sleep should be

neon lights blink
glances pass underneath
dark lashes

hung over the bed
the unpainted painting
mosquito netting

still standing
where others lived
abandoned cabin

abandoned
a photo of someone's eyes
moving in the wind

one bird
its cry so human
alone

accepting aging

wrinkling up
along the shore
an old ocean

mom leaves
the door partly open
her many years

cricket shapes
arthritic knuckles
of shortened days

child's fingers
trace on grandma's hands
the liver spots of aging

an old sea crone
remembering mermaid tales
as true

hot flashes
blushes of youth
getting old

grandmother squeezing
on her driver's license
the name of many men

arguments

box canyon walls
being with someone
you hate

in box canyon
the narrow-mined couple
argue

after the quarrel
chewed cheeks
saying the words

belief in spirits

sacred grove
a spirit trade
oaks and I

fairy ring
all past secrets
come to light

spirit circle
journeys from thing to thing
pass-me-not

mountain wind
the spirit eye sees
traveling far

sunset
illumination of other worlds
clouds

flute notes
in spirit rocks
answers

leaving
in a dream soul
in the lizard

morning cliffs
two crows play tag
with spirit shadows

spirit pictures
etched in sandstone
the unseen hand

spirit bodies
waving from cacti
plastic sacks

Nevada spirit lands
garbage blowing
in bushes

spirit in retreat
cleaning first the black stove
a cup of cold water

mission spirits
in swallows and pigeons
birds of paradise

morning light
stretches down the cliff
its spirit shape

decay

waiting room
a patch of sunlight
wears out the chairs

recycling old glass
the rocky beach
jewel-covered coves

windless surf
how easily the old folks
are entertained

worn-down hills
folding into earth
an old dog sits

elephant parade
the old aunt absently fingers
her throat

clown's old car
when it falls apart
papa doesn't laugh

surprised
in the dark blood
is black

his hot cheeks
whitened by moonlight
the reformed poet

a howling wind
at the deep ache
a broken bone

weathered palms
the scythe well-sharpened
worn in the center

an old woman
carrying a balloon
dusk lowers

footsteps
a language of cripples
writing

death by death
with the passing of a friend
my own nears

afternoon sun
on grandma's brown hands
star wrinkles

the stable roof
shingle for shingle
coming down

Ikebana
centered around the leaf
with worm holes

cracked
the antique china cup fills
a break in my lifeline

rented house
wishing my night gown
had all its buttons

autumn path
a stick talking to stone
the blind man's way

fears of deception

moonlighting
the thief employed
as security guard

petrified forest
you buy a souvenir
for your lover

your lies
as many sizes of the moon
I should believe?

heartless
the moon's bright body
attracts lovers

garlic toes
clinging to his voice
the salesman

prayers
our feet stuck in sands
whispering about us

casting doubts
clouds on the hills
on her face

used car salesman
a banana peel lies
three feet from his

after lies
seeing by moonlight
whose who is what

emptiness

cold crescent moon
sound of a boat leaving
with the departed

mother's death
the umbilical cord to earth
empty

empty
the vacation house watches
us drive by

her heat
even the ashes
not cool

without them
hanging on to things
of parents

seeing the old home
to fill the emptiness
chattering birds

a nest
found in autumn
the empty sky

empty afternoon
eyes and ears fill
with tears

as empty as
Sunday afternoon's envelope
your rejection is

filling the washer
with an empty heart
your blue shirts

autumn storms
locking emptiness
into summer cabins

tiredness
filling the emptiness
evenings

used tires
loaded on a truck
without wheels

sea fog
walking the valley
with empty hands

endings

crossing the road
shadow of a stop sign
stops

fears

shadows
of an upright stone
splashing waves

lifting a shadow
the gull frightened
by waves

grief

stone mountain
saying good-bye to him
was even harder
(For Charles B. Dickson)

jealousy

jealous lovers
at sea storm clouds
with purple waters

slender moon
so little fire
yet you go to him

tides
sorting beach debris
a jealous woman

leavings

leaving home
rain drops in my eyes
for clearer vision

grandkids leaving
the only smiles
on pictures they drew

leaving 
the low tide beach
fills

facing one another
the chairs open and empty
as guests leave

weak fall sun
chairs by the café sit
on each other's lap

leaving
dust holds your footprints
and me

walking on rocks
where tears splashed down
dad's farewell

wind-filled rain
tears at the leaves
someone is going

guests gone
the only stars
in the sieve

guests gone
huckleberries ripen
in the silence

noodle soup
memories of your visit
in the left-overs

kissing good-bye
she feels the edge
of his pocket


leaving Germany
raindrops in my eyes
tears

lingering summer thoughts

autumn's summer heat
on a white paper you drew
a smiling sun

loneliness

to sleep alone
in the light of the moon
madness

loneliness
crossing the great plains
high tension wires

a lonely day
yet in the afternoon
a breeze comes by

alone
in the desert
wind

on the porch
mold-speckled pine needles
my waiting for you

a son's call
white waves of long distance
returning to shore

kids gone
sea waves return to shore
each alone

foggy Saturday night
a woman's whiskey-raw voice
pours from a radio

singing low
sea-white fog disappears
beneath the pines

divorced parents
the cries of the neighbor kids
deep in the woods

the waitress' tip
lying in spilled beer
small brown coins

longing

dreams
burning desire
burning

burning pine
smoke blown about
my longing

deer at the salt lick
so my memories of us
will you return too?

loss


fireplace sunshine
dark in the burned-out cabin
weeds

too late
lovers looking in windows
of closed shops

touching your left sleeve
at this moment of parting
how cold is your coat

watercolor class
a blue sky pinned to the wall
falls

a deaf child
in autumn hearing
the sleep of seeds

lost
in hidden valley
the trail

on the gramophone
a church in Holland
where you are tonight

passing time


early morning sun
on the face of the clock
time change

time was
my eyes in the empty place
where the clock isn't

golden clock hands
sunshine slants through leaves
passing time

past life experiences

moon dreams
a spotlight turns on
past lives

fingernails
windows to the past
lives

white waves returning
to shore their call
for me to come home

regrets

low-tide walk
now deep at sea
my path

at the waterfalls
a woman remembering
a love affair

at least the moon
when it's full
comes to my porch

ribbon knots
tighten a lump in the throat
as it was that night...

heavy heart
such a color evenings
weighs nothing

rest

taking a rest
I let the city noises
leak out of my ears

sadness

pillar of sorrow
the hours alone
touching it

deep sighing
waves climb the beach
and disappear

earth turns
shadows on a face
fade and reappear

stepping stones
go wobbly and uneven
tears falling

autumn sadness
yet before the leaf falls
the swelling bud

eyelash splash
curve in the folding
a wave of tears

the cutting edge
your words where the moon
touches night

yet another pine
is the moon ever free
of the earth?

unknown

spirit of a place
a film
on the photograph

breathing heavily
atop the mountain gorge
a thick cloud

knuckles of night
cold without human flesh
tap along the roof

forces
holding rocks together
apart

mountain top
aglow with the unseen
moon

walking paths
the land fluid
without feet

after death
naming the unknown
heaven/earth

voices
familiar things
without shadow

doors
swinging pendulums
between outsiders

moon shadows
coming up the stairs
a creaking sound

between two birds
in bright shapes
a real name

flagstones
then the border blew away
in colored silk

surf sounds
someone was walking
on trackless sand

bad dreams
the shapes of dinner
eaten late

night bumps
all around the house
other things

spindrift veils
above the crashing waves
finer ones

without wind
a door opens
the candle goes out

a stand of trees
in a setting of weeds
someone kneeling

standing ajar
for the passage of souls
a door in October

incense
smoke in the wind chimes
faint tones of blue

bones
hearing sea winds of the dead
in flute tones

secret mists
on the broad river
lost shadows

lost shadows
on the dark river
time curves

a creaking floor
the moonlight goes
from room to room

moon path
on the water where I walk
a bridge to ...

sunset
the shadow steps back
into your heel

two foreign stamps
found in a dream book
borrowed

walking on the mountain
without a step
going inside of it

still alive
in knotty pine walls
dragon eyes

without words
angels' voices return
songs

giant forest
moving between trees
a deeper darkness

giant forest
walking the dark road
night trees

at the pass
a bright neon-blue bush
the future

the unseen

mineral waters
perfume the skin
a bright soul

lizard
in the slits of his eyes
my soul window

beach wind
taking off her prayer cap
unseen temple

worries

many night thoughts
the big dipper tilts
spilling over

till standing
where others lived
abandoned cabin

dusting the dresser
a gown which shared
our passion

death
the star sailor
home again

as dreams
wood in an iron stove
falls into ash

bubbles and branches
ice moving
the I Ching hexagram

tree roots
bones of the dead
leaving earth

a carved name
smelling of bone marrow
round and white

last days
as thin as her skin
loose on bones

people who die
when the sea is full
a law of foam

silence
between old folks
no longer breathing

tracing the blue
veins on her breast
winter

baby's ancient face
wrinkled and sexless
grandparents

touchstone
the body arching the abyss
death

antique
mirroring on TV
gone with the wind

boredom

bored by winter
wild surf waters knot
sea grass

bored with winter
a beach walk finds
abandoned toys

another rainy day
cleaning out of the toaster
crumbs

silence
around the old couple
all their repeated words

silence
faces at the party
in a mirror

blocked

after hours of conflict
white waves no longer mount
the black rock

blank book
eyes filled with
waves and wind

cold the room
when the last of the ink
has been written

complaints of being old

without a lamp
the moonlight turns
my hair white

black ink
the many poems dye
my hair white

spilled wine
finger prints on the glass
shaking

young at heart
still the roses fade
on her nightie

a haircut
less white
on this old woman

winter road
a sharp turn
to the nursing home

gaining weight
the world thicker
with snow

winter leaving
another blue vein
on her leg

first snow
I'm not one year older
anymore

gazing at her photograph
the glass reflects
an older face

painted silver
her wrinkles mar
the smooth glass

fifty years
not remembering which
toothbrush is his

aging beauty
truth lies on the mirror
reversed

complaints of the cold

winter so cold
the sun leaves earlier
each day

midnight room
rays of candlelight
star-cold

night cold
surf's surge and boom
in the bathtub

lying in bed
cold beside my sleep
wide awake

delight in company

a new winter friend
up the year's steep sloping
our flow of words

- for Brent Partridge

your poem
the brief language
of footsteps

bird song
under winter quilts
bodies touching

together
your tip glows
as incense burns

seaweed tied in knots
ashore in winter storm
we stick together

necking
the never-ending story
movie forgotten

telephone call
your smile in a space
you've never gone

curved ink
the warmth of your hand
in the letters

charmed
a sunny day in winter
a new you

ice melting
her hand touches
his

a glow
the whole candle
a flame

angels
dreams on your face
my eyes

appearing
me in your dream
you in my...

uplifting
light hearts
magic

this vow
written so deep
in dreams

their eyes
as a priest raises the wine
blood rushes to her cheeks

desire for company

evening alone
only pine mountain
my guest

northeaster storm
yet feelings of longing
dare the cross winds

quilt patterns
the full moon's path
of my desire

deep in winter
no one comes to say
"Look, it's snowing."

desert
silence between us
cold at night

waiting for you
the dull swish
of my raincoat

pines
bowed with snow
my longing

sleeping
your image in dreams
awakens

in my dream
you touch me
awake

it's black
the road that takes
you from me

waiting for guests
the corner of the rug
keeps turning up

something's coming
in winter's high-water marks
a dry rustle

earth frozen dry
leaves behind my wide cape
thus I search for you

wet chalk
it's been such a long time
since you've written

grinding more ink
the only thought that comes
tender as the rain

the chalk of her pelvis
beacons for a child's soul
now draws a line

distant daughter
hearing her coins drop
into a telephone

driftwood hermitage
cold and loneliness
take up the pen

pages filled
yet the stamp carries away
unspoken words

sleeping alone
the cold side
of the bed

desire for spring

wild surf
shaking the sunny beach
our desire for spring

salt crusts
thin skin on a blown beach
this itching

dreams under the tent
of the Burpee seed catalog
winter gardens

eaves dripping
the candle flame
flickers

in the back of my brain
a photo of your eyes
watching my day

blue on the postcard
how far from the sea
we both are

winter days
a heart runs without panting
to the beach

depression

nothing in nature
truly black
my moods

discipline

breathing
underlining sentences
in a book

unknown keys in a box
she takes a vow
- no more love affairs

estrangement

after the argument
the sound of your eyelashes
brushing the pillow

winter cold
the sound of ocean waves
between us in bed

tears not shed
at your leaving
a sinus drip

silence
between your words
anger

silence
after something falls
a coming apart

silence
between words
stories

silence
before the answer
truth

a lover's quarrel
the seamstress tries
to patch things up

fears

asleep
surrounded by things
that don't

hard to believe
the someone touching the roof
is only rain

panic
as rain presses
the window's dark sound
sun on a pine branch
laughing shadow image
a jackeral's face


ghost stories
beyond the fire circle
old/new noises

bear stories
interrupted by the clatter
of a garbage can

precipice
the wind blows stronger
my fear of falling

awakened
by the hours of night
an owl's dream

dreams
turning on the light
staying in the dark

nervous
the whole house shakes
in the wind

three minutes
from here to eternity
a phone call

flickering candle
I'm not the only one
who is scared

moving eyes
objects reproduced
a silence of mirrors

fog fear
things so familiar
they have no shadow

from where come ideas
now when frogs are still
as cold stars

last light
glasses comes alive
to watch out the night

 

feeling childlike

at the airport
in the town where I was born
sinking into the mud

by a dormant tree
someone is singing
as the scythe rusts

grief for the dead

grief
hours alone lift our feet
from the knowing

alive
the dead go walking
in my feet

mind wandering
dragging a heart-spun net
in heavy seas

a branch
fallen to the roof
downward and sloping

dead
and this morning
he'll never see

helplessness

sea spray climbs sheer cliff
on the beach without legs
a man in a wheelchair

for her window
Persian patterns of a rug
wheelchair spokes

isolation

winter moon
alone it journeys northward
brightens my doorstep

her face
a fold in fabric
smiles

palest butterflies
trapped in paper cages
letters in winter

she saw reflected
in the dampness of his eyes
herself alone

gray painted
the level landscape
life as a photo

a white room
its walls drawing in
the energy patterns

only the candle
reads my poems
wavers in the wind

in my chair
listening to my music
a stranger

silence so profound
it takes the shape
of your inner ear

isolated farms
the white sky of snowdrifts
outlining the cold

fog
closing the brushwood gate
silences ocean waves

leaving a book
blind hands touch
her own smile

window
a filter of snow
winter blind

stairs
where no one speaks
or rises

alone again
with the wind in the pines
somewhere else

gone -
yet the space you left
shines with light

alone
building a fire
for company

alone
in the fire
voices

a strange land
saying I love you
again

the wind dies
the sound in one's own ears
empty

joy of living

enjoying life
for all the dead
the yet unborn

his face aglow
the deaf child
making signs

"Come see the sunset?"
the old woman too busy
for endings

- for Caroline Sutherland

touching me
during the ballet
his left hand

madness

winter madness
parachuting to earth
pale blue creatures dangle

motionless


written in a dream
all three lives
now forgotten

boxlike silence
after the grandparents leave
empty rooms

pain


a chalk drawing
a piece of amber
very near pain

in my ear
hurtful blood sounds
of the sea

your words
the wind rubs the lake
the wrong way

peace

another tranquillizer
the cat begins to purr
more r's in the room

winter weaves
a pile of pillows
on a hard chair

comforter
buttoned to the bed
a curled-up cat

curving waves
sleep carries away
candlelight

packing
arms of the flannel shirt
holding on to peace

smoothed by seas
a nearly round rock
points homeward

home again
raking in the Zen garden
the oldest pattern

driftwood hermitage
a well-chewed stick
writes in the sand

poor

too poor
for a luxury house
walking a deserted beach

his crooked face
peering into a puddle
for a dropped penny

silence
marked down half-price
the broken squeak toy

release

cloud-covered
a departed soul
sky-blue

wind still
Grandma's afternoon nap
lasts forever

the string cut
in death feet go awry
walking labyrinths

no!
the grave is not the end
we remember too much

remembering

twilight
finding in an old album
dad is still young

opening her closet
secrets alive in the colors
she has worn

snow
pictures of other lands
other lovers

winter colors
passing in sleep
dream zones

measuring
the box once again
inside

underground
the Celtic cauldron
a ringing bell

winter dreams
lingering on long arms
summer warmed

I touch myself
with lacquered nails
as you once did

memories
stored in our muscles
an iron will

without a shadow
on bright days
the hand I know

rejection

mailbox
a frozen puddle overflows
a rejection slip

bedtime story
"I love you." he said
leaving to meet a lover

ebb tide
anger and rejection
sucked out to sea

filled by the sea
the stony places
of hurting

all my anger
singing with the vacuum
cleaner

rows of holes
edging the stamp
of your last letter

after our words
on the lace tablecloth
cut flowers

data processing
her letters from New York
in winter

restlessness

gutted candle
if only I too
could sleep

sea wind
searching me for something
someone I once was

desiring freedom
her photos no longer
capture views

misty red daybreak
newly lit fires in the kitchen
wish to be on a train

solitude

sweet cold
incense in a winter room
alone

treasure
in a seashell serene colors
a day alone

a roof of rain
the sound inside
solitude

silence
after you've gone
the widening world

silence
when all alone
a tunnel

a corner
the shape of solitude
chair and book

deaf child
patterns of a Persian rug
echoing

winter
the hours melting
into snowflakes

still awake
on top of the comforter
one feather

long damp beach
winter solstice
at ebb tide

walking in a fog
a solitary person attended
by angels

the shape of wind
writing in dunes
loneliness

alone in the house
the flavor of peppermint
cold on the tongue

a journey begins
the way familiar
to the door

frozen to his feet
the length of a shadow
wanting to sleep

alone in the room
the gaudy television
and me smiling

empty coffee cup
the face looking at me
gone

tight shut

"origami"
she explained folding
up the dollar bills

uselessness

homeless man
tied to his sleeping bag
shoes going nowhere

art store sale
the poet buys erasers
at a discount

an old maid
her favorite dancing dress
yellows the attic

warm-breath wind
words are helpless
on parted lips

since birth unemployed
the rich man
and his navel

weeping

darkness welling up
cold waters of the sea
a sob

songs of sorrow
the harp string breaks
the fall of tears

laughter
after the argument
sounds like sobs

a blue wave
on the crest
an eyelid closed

swirling dust
excitement flickers
within the tent

circus
red flags flutter
hearts

acrobats

backstage the heat
everyone squirms

tinsel flash
under shiny sweat
goose bumps

magic act
wondering where the scarf went
when the wind blew

high wire act
on the ground children dance
arms outstretched

intermission
all the real clowns stand up
and smile

between acts
the quiet music
of bowing trees

clown act
without a tent
the wind as wild

part of the joke
clapping for stagehands
who fix the pole

empty morning light
the trampled grass circle
of the circus tent

dog days

dog days
a bitch in heat
laceless shoes

Mid-summer's Eve
lately bracken fern
invisible

black pine
against the never dark sky

her brief white gown
shortens the night

fog dissolves

one last splash of a wave
I am gone too

in cookie jars

between soft evening peaks

into the sea

in the beginning
before we awake
there's the ocean

leaping out of dark seas
a wave

you breath as lightly
as the sky

refreshed by sleep

a blush of pink

gentled by rolling
hills to the sea

coming unrolled

into the cove

in me

the white world of waves
spinning

a damp breathing
from a rock

sucking from the spring
a life sound

standing beside a mother
at a child's grave

out of the grave

pushes the light

a frosty night
gravestones rise
the width of a crack

hole in the silence
grave diggers alone
lower the coffin

between the graves
fences between friends
falling apart

visiting graves
the stone at dusk
warms

visiting graves
stone gardens lengthen
autumn's cool

his grave
filled with
his earth

his grave
covered with
my sky

rain
covering his grave
with low clouds

juicy blackberries
under the tangled vines

after visiting graves
a night of fever-chills
their nightmares

afraid to take nap
while visiting graves

gravestones

in a patch of weeds

sinks in

marking those things
that don't die

in a closed house

the deed signed
taking down the birdhouse
dad built

bodies buried
and now the house belongs
to someone else

stretch down the road
draw us home

slants over a hand-made house
paints it September

at a beach picnic

by low tide now covered
with night waters

have a sound

fill the open field

on western waters

waving the ocean's brightness
a blue-white flag

winter white
on the ocean's block of blue
melting crust of foam

each flat wave
a dirty gray

with storm wild waves

falling from angel shoulders

warms spindrift
in the sun

a million years ago

and slow
